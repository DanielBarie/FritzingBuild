# FritzingBuild
Building Fritzing 

# What?
Obviously building fritzing for teaching purposes. End goal is having a release and building a VM for students to explore electrical circuits using fritzing.

# Why?
There's instructions for building fritzing on their Github: https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki/1.-Building-Fritzing
These do only refer to building from qt Studio, so you'll have to go through qt studio every time you might want to launch the app. Suboptimal for teaching purposes. Release build instructions (https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki/4.-Publishing-a-Release) are outdated with a link to setting up a build VM leading nowhere. The missing instructions are located at https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/wiki/4.1-Via-Linux-on-a-virtual-box but refer to a very old Ubuntu release as build platform. 

So I decided to try this with a newer release of Ubuntu, here we go.
